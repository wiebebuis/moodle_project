# moodle_project
My first repository working towards writing my own moodle plugins focusing on music theory

After building my own Joomla website I started with my own Moodle environment. 
I have seen the very nice contributions of Justin Hunt on Youtube.
Also I fiddled around a little bit with the work of Eric Brisson.
Now planning to write my own mmusic theory plugin  building on the work of Eric and Justin.
